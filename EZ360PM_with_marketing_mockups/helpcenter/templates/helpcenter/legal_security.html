<p>
  We take security seriously. This page describes security safeguards we use to help protect Personal Information
  and User Content, as well as steps you should take to keep your account secure.
</p>

<h2 class="h5 mt-4">Security Safeguards</h2>
<p>
  We use reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational measures designed to protect Personal
  Information and User Content against unauthorized access, loss, misuse, alteration, and disclosure. These
  measures may include access controls, encryption in transit, monitoring, logging, and least-privilege internal
  access.
</p>

<p>
  No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure. You are responsible for using strong passwords, keeping
  credentials confidential, and promptly notifying us of suspected unauthorized access.
</p>

<h2 class="h5 mt-4">Account Security</h2>
<ul>
  <li>You are responsible for all activity under your account.</li>
  <li>Keep your credentials confidential and use strong, unique passwords.</li>
  <li>Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) where available or required by your organization.</li>
  <li>If you believe your account has been compromised, notify us immediately.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  If you believe your account has been compromised, contact
  <a href="mailto:support@ez360pm.com">support@ez360pm.com</a>. We may require credential resets and may
  temporarily suspend access to protect you and the platform.
