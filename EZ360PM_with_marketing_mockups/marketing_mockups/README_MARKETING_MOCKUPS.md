# EZ360PM Marketing Mockups (HTML + Mock Data)

These pages are **static HTML** marketing mockups that use your real UI stylesheet:

- `static/css/ez360pm.css`
- Bootstrap 5.3 + Bootstrap Icons (CDN)

They are designed so you can open them locally and take clean screenshots for the public marketing homepage **before you have real in-app screenshots with data**.

## Files

- `marketing_mockups/index.html`
- `marketing_mockups/documents_invoicing.html`
- `marketing_mockups/time_tracking.html`
- `marketing_mockups/accounting_reports.html`
- `marketing_mockups/integrations.html`

## How to use

1. Open `marketing_mockups/index.html` in your browser.
2. Click into a module mockup.
3. Optional: toggle light/dark using the moon button.
4. Set browser zoom to **100%**.
5. Take a screenshot.

### Suggested screenshot sizes

- Desktop hero tiles: **1400×900** or **1600×1000**
- Square feature cards: **1200×1200** (crop from the above)

## Notes

- The pages reference assets by relative path (`../static/...`).
- If you move these pages elsewhere, update those paths.
- The mock data uses your preferred invoice numbering vibe (e.g. `2602-01`) and realistic financial UI.
