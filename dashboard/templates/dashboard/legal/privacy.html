    and legal requirements. You may request deletion as described below.

    We do not “sell” personal information as defined by the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA/CPRA). If we engage in
    sharing for cross-context behavioral advertising, you may opt out using available controls or by visiting:
    {% if do_not_sell_url %}
      <a href="{{ do_not_sell_url }}" rel="noopener">{{ do_not_sell_url }}</a>
    {% else %}
      <em>(link to your Do-Not-Sell/Share page)</em>

    We use trusted subprocessors to provide the Service (e.g., cloud hosting, email delivery, payment processing). For transparency,
    we may publish a list here:
    {% if subprocessors_url %}
      <a href="{{ subprocessors_url }}" rel="noopener">{{ subprocessors_url }}</a>
