{% block help_body %}
<p>A/R is the money clients owe you. In EZ360PM, A/R is driven by invoices, payments, credits, and refunds.</p>

<div class="fw-semibold mb-2">Core objects</div>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Invoice</strong> creates A/R (what the client owes).</li>
  <li><strong>Payment</strong> reduces A/R.</li>
  <li><strong>Client credit</strong> reduces A/R (credit ledger + applications).</li>
  <li><strong>Refund</strong> can increase A/R again if you reverse a payment, and/or increase client credit depending on how the original payment was allocated.</li>
</ul>

<div class="fw-semibold mb-2">Key rules</div>
<ul>
  <li>Invoices should be treated as <strong>immutable</strong> after sending/locking (policy varies by company settings).</li>
  <li>Credits are tracked in a <strong>ledger</strong> and then <strong>applied</strong> to invoices.</li>
  <li>Ops-grade checks validate that totals, payments, refunds, and credits remain consistent.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="fw-semibold">Where to look</div>
  <div class="small">
    Use <strong>Reports → A/R Aging</strong> for outstanding balances, and <strong>Clients</strong> for credit balances.
