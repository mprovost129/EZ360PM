<h2 class="h5 mt-4">5. Data Retention</h2>
<p>
  We retain Personal Information for as long as your account is active, as necessary to provide Services, to comply
  with legal obligations, and to resolve disputes. When you delete data or close an account, we may retain certain
  records for legal/compliance and may keep limited backup copies for a period of time.
</p>

<h2 class="h5 mt-4">6. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
<p>
  We use cookies and similar technologies (e.g., local storage and server logs) to operate, secure, and improve
  EZ360PM.
</p>

<p class="mb-1"><strong>Types of cookies we use:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Strictly necessary cookies</strong>: required for core functionality (authentication, session management, security controls, CSRF protection).</li>
  <li><strong>Preferences cookies</strong>: remember settings such as your selected company, UI preferences, and “don’t show again” prompts.</li>
  <li><strong>Analytics/performance (optional)</strong>: help us understand usage and improve reliability (e.g., feature adoption, performance diagnostics). We configure analytics to avoid collecting unnecessary personal data and to exclude sensitive fields where feasible.</li>
</ul>

<p class="mb-1"><strong>Your choices:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>You can control cookies through your browser settings and, where available, in-app preferences.</li>
  <li>Disabling some cookies may affect functionality (for example, you may be unable to log in or stay signed in).</li>
  <li><strong>Do Not Track:</strong> Some browsers offer “Do Not Track” signals. There is no consistent industry standard for responding to these signals, so EZ360PM may not respond to them uniformly.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="h5 mt-4">7. Security</h2>
<p>
  We implement administrative, technical, and organizational measures designed to protect Personal Information and
  User Content against unauthorized access, loss, misuse, alteration, and disclosure. Measures may include access
  controls, encryption in transit, monitoring, logging, and least-privilege internal access.
</p>
<p>
  No system is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security. You are responsible for using strong
  passwords, keeping credentials confidential, and promptly notifying us of suspected unauthorized access.
</p>

<h2 class="h5 mt-4">8. Automated Processing &amp; AI</h2>
<p>
  EZ360PM may use automated systems to detect fraud, monitor performance, provide intelligent insights, and assist
  with support tools. We do not use fully automated decision-making that produces legal or similarly significant
  effects without human review.
</p>

<h2 class="h5 mt-4">9. Data Transfers</h2>
<p>
  EZ360PM is based in the United States. Personal Information may be processed and stored in the United States or
  other jurisdictions where our service providers operate. If you access our Services from outside the U.S., you
  consent to the transfer of information to the United States.
</p>

  portability, withdrawal of consent, and non-discrimination for exercising privacy rights.

  cannot reasonably identify any individual.
