<p>
  This Refund Policy applies to EZ360PM subscriptions and seat fees. It is intended to summarize the refund-related
  terms in the Terms of Service.
</p>

<h2 class="h5 mt-4">Refunds; Proration; Credits</h2>

<p>
  <strong>Refunds.</strong> Unless required by law, all subscription fees and seat fees are non-refundable and
  non-creditable, including for partially used billing periods.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Proration.</strong> If you cancel, your subscription remains active until the end of your current billing
  period. We do not provide prorated refunds or credits for unused time.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Upgrades/Downgrades.</strong> If you upgrade your plan or add seats, the change may take effect immediately
  and you authorize us (via Stripe) to charge any applicable difference. Downgrades and seat reductions typically
  take effect at the next renewal.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Chargebacks and Payment Disputes.</strong> If you initiate a chargeback or payment dispute, we may suspend
  access to the Services while we investigate. You agree to provide information reasonably requested to resolve
  disputes.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Free Trials.</strong> Trial access (if offered) is provided “as is.” If you do not cancel before the trial
  ends, you authorize us to begin billing according to the plan you selected.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Taxes.</strong> Taxes collected (if any) are non-refundable except as required by law.
</p>
